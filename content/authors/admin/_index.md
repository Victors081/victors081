In everything I do, I believe in telling stories. To do this, I use robust, efficient and easy for others to understand data analysis. In other words, I make people understand better their context and make better decisions.

I am very interested in economic research, business analytics and data analytics for decision making. In my free time I enjoy solving Rubik's cubes, reading, meditating, drinking coffee and programming.
